# 📜 RL Papers in Finance

A curated list of research papers on **Reinforcement Learning (RL) applied in Finance and Trading**. This includes portfolio optimization, algorithmic trading, market making, and risk management. RL enables agents to learn optimal decision-making by maximizing reward signals based on market conditions, historical data, and technical indicators. It has been widely applied in automated trading, high-frequency strategies, and real-time market adaptation. However, the effectiveness of RL in finance depends on data quality, model design, and reward function optimization, while challenges like market non-stationarity and partial observability must be carefully addressed.
